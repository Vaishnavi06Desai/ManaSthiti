## About The Project

### The Problem ManaSthiti Solves
Mental health is crucial in maintaining our overall well-being, but stigma often prevents people from seeking help. With **ManaSthiti**, we aim to raise awareness, encourage engagement, and create a supportive environment for mental health management.

This interactive platform addresses the growing need for mental health awareness and community support. It offers features designed to help users manage their mental state, learn about mental health, and seek help when needed.

### Key Features
- **Mood Tracker**: Track your emotional well-being. If you notice consistent low mood, it might be a sign to seek professional help. Colorful and motivating design keeps users engaged.
- **Comics Page**: Enjoy mental health-focused comics that normalize discussions about mental health while adding a touch of fun.
- **Forum to Discuss**: Share your thoughts anonymously or publicly. A safe space to connect and express your feelings on important topics.
- **Games**: Engage in games that are both entertaining and educational. They help users learn about mental health in an enjoyable way.
- **Safe Rooms**: A calming experience to relax and meditate with soothing beats and immersive environments like beaches, forests, and even a mall.

### Challenges We Ran Into
The tight time constraints were a challenge, but efficient time management helped us build a complete product. Implementing the "Jeopardy" game and ensuring smooth functionality across all features was a learning experience that improved our skills!
